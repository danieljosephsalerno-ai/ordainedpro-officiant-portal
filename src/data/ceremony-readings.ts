    text: `Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. Love never fails.`,

    text: `Two are better than one, because they have a good return for their labor: If either of them falls down, one can help the other up. But pity anyone who falls and has no one to help them up. Also, if two lie down together, they will keep warm. But how can one keep warm alone? Though one may be overpowered, two can defend themselves. A cord of three strands is not quickly broken.`,

    text: `Let me not to the marriage of true minds\nAdmit impediments. Love is not love\nWhich alters when it alteration finds,\nOr bends with the remover to remove.\nO no! it is an ever-fixed mark\nThat looks on tempests and is never shaken;\nIt is the star to every wandering bark,\nWhose worth's unknown, although his height be taken.\nLove's not Time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks\nWithin his bending sickle's compass come;\nLove alters not with his brief hours and weeks,\nBut bears it out even to the edge of doom.\nIf this be error and upon me proved,\nI never writ, nor no man ever loved.`,

Let me count the ways.\nI love thee to the depth and breadth and height\nMy soul can reach, when feeling out of sight\nFor the ends of being and ideal grace.\nI love thee to the level of every day's\nMost quiet need, by sun and candle-light.\nI love thee freely, as men strive for right.\nI love thee purely, as they turn from praise.\nI love thee with the passion put to use\nIn my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.\nI love thee with a love I seemed to lose\nWith my lost saints. I love thee with the breath,\nSmiles, tears, of all my life; and, if God choose,\nI shall but love thee better after death.`,

    text: `Happiness in marriage is not something that just happens. A good marriage must be created. In the art of marriage, the little things are the big things. It is never being too old to hold hands. It is remembering to say "I love you" at least once a day. It is never going to sleep angry. It is having a mutual sense of values and common objectives. It is standing together facing the world. It is forming a circle of love that gathers in the whole family. It is speaking words of appreciation and demonstrating gratitude in thoughtful ways. It is having the capacity to forgive and forget. It is giving each other an atmosphere in which each can grow.`,

From that moment of yes, to this moment of yes, indeed, you have been making commitments in an informal way. All of those conversations that were held in a car, or over a meal, or during long walks\u2014all those conversations that began with, "When we're married," and continued with "I will" and "you will" and "we will"\u2014all those late-night talks that included "someday" and "somehow" and "maybe"\u2014and all those promises that are unspoken matters of the heart.

The Lovely Other Dinosaur melted the Dinosaur's cage with kind words and loving thoughts. "I like this Dinosaur," thought the Lovely Other Dinosaur.
