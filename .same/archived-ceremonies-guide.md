# Archived Ceremonies Feature - User Guide

## Overview
The **Archived Ceremonies** feature allows you to deactivate completed or cancelled weddings, removing them from the active ceremony list while preserving all their data for future reference.

## How to Archive a Ceremony

### Method 1: Using the Active Ceremony Badge
1. Make sure the ceremony you want to archive is currently active
2. Click on the **"Active Ceremony"** badge in the top right header (green badge)
3. The status will toggle to **"Archived Ceremony"** (red badge)
4. You'll receive a confirmation message that the ceremony has been moved to the archived section

### Method 2: After Ceremony Completion
- When a wedding ceremony is complete, click the Active Ceremony badge to archive it
- This removes it from your active workflow while keeping all data intact

## Viewing Archived Ceremonies

### From Scripts Tab
1. Navigate to the **Scripts** tab
2. Look for the **"Script Actions"** section on the right sidebar
3. Click the **"Archived Ceremonies"** button (first button in the list)
4. The Archived Ceremonies dialog will open

### From Switch Ceremony Dialog
1. Click **"Switch Ceremony"** button in the header
2. At the bottom of the dialog, click **"View Archived Ceremonies"**
3. The Archived Ceremonies dialog will open

## What Happens When You Archive

**Archived ceremonies are:**
- ✅ Hidden from the Switch Ceremony dialog
- ✅ Removed from your active workflow
- ✅ Preserved with all data intact (messages, files, scripts, tasks, etc.)
- ✅ Accessible through the Archived Ceremonies dialog
- ✅ Restorable at any time

**Archived ceremonies do NOT:**

3. Click the **"Restore Ceremony"** button (green button with checkmark)
4. The ceremony will be immediately moved back to active status
5. You can now switch to it and continue working on it

## Archived Ceremonies Dialog Features

The dialog shows:
- **Couple names** with bride and groom information
- **Contact details** (emails and phone numbers)
- **Wedding details** (venue, date)
- **Archived badge** indicating the ceremony is not active
- **Restore button** to reactivate the ceremony

## Use Cases

**When to Archive:**
- Wedding ceremony has been completed
- Couple cancelled their wedding

- End of wedding season cleanup

**When to Restore:**
- Need to reference past ceremony details

## Best Practices

1. **Archive after completion**: Once a wedding is done, archive it to keep your active list focused
2. **Regular cleanup**: Periodically review and archive old ceremonies
3. **Don't delete**: Use archiving instead of deleting - you never know when you might need the data
4. **Easy restoration**: Archived ceremonies can be restored instantly if needed
5. **Data preservation**: All messages, scripts, files, and details are preserved

## Tips

- The badge in the header always shows the current ceremony's status

- You can switch between active ceremonies without affecting archived ones
